        "Have you ever wanted to make your text messages more expressive? Your emojifier app will help you do that. \n",

        "* You will implement a model which inputs a sentence (such as \"Let's go see the baseball game tonight!\") and finds the most appropriate emoji to be used with this sentence (‚öæÔ∏è).\n",

        "#### Using word vectors to improve emoji lookups\n",
        "* In many emoji interfaces, you need to remember that ‚ù§Ô∏è is the \"heart\" symbol rather than the \"love\" symbol. \n",
        "    * In other words, you'll have to remember to type \"heart\" to find the desired emoji, and typing \"love\" won't bring up that symbol.\n",
        "* We can make a more flexible emoji interface by using word vectors!\n",
        "* When using word vectors, you'll see that even if your training set explicitly relates only a few words to a particular emoji, your algorithm will be able to generalize and associate additional words in the test set to the same emoji.\n",
        "    * This works even if those additional words don't even appear in the training set. \n",
        "    * This allows you to build an accurate classifier mapping from sentences to emojis, even using a small training set. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### What you'll build\n",
        "1. In this exercise, you'll start with a baseline model (Emojifier-V1) using word embeddings.\n",
